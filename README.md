## Class Imbalance Resolver

### Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of class imbalance, specifically in the context of fraud detection. A common issue in datasets where fraudulent cases are rare is that traditional machine learning models struggle to detect minority classes effectively. This project leverages Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and other oversampling techniques to enhance the detection of minority classes, leading to improved accuracy, precision, and recall in fraud detection tasks.

### Key Features
- **Class Imbalance Resolution**: Developed an approach to improve the identification and performance metrics of minority classes.
- **Oversampling Techniques**: Implemented targeted oversampling methods such as SMOTE and Duplication to increase minority class representation in the dataset.
- **Improved Metrics**: Achieved 95.6% overall accuracy in fraud detection, with significant gains in precision and recall for the minority class.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:
- imbalanced-learn
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Prepare the dataset (see the Dataset section).
3. Run the script to implement class imbalance resolution techniques and train the fraud detection model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project focuses on fraud detection, where fraudulent cases represent the minority class. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and placed in the appropriate directory before running the model.

## Methodology
- **Class Imbalance Approach**: Developed an approach to specifically address class imbalance by enhancing the identification of minority classes.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Applied SMOTE to create synthetic samples for the minority class, balancing the dataset.
- **Duplication**: Used duplication techniques as an additional targeted oversampling method to further enhance minority class detection.

## Results
- Achieved **95.6% overall accuracy** in fraud detection.
- Significant improvements in **precision** and **recall** for the minority class, demonstrating the effectiveness of the class imbalance resolution techniques.
